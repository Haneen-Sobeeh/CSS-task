  <h1>Hello Im Haneen,and I love Cat.</h1>
  <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.<br>  Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.</p>
